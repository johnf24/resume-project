# Interactive Resume Project
An interactive resume application developed using jQuery that reads data from a JSON file and then dynamically modifies the DOM to display the information. The resume was further customized by personalizing the design using CSS.

This is the second project for the [Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) co-created by AT&T, Google, GitHub and Hack Reactor.
